Firebase functions API specifications for Kotlin. Provides IDE suggestions

You can add this project as a dependency to your kotlinjs + firebase project in order to get
autocompletion for firebase functions.

Please note that not all functions are yet available and some are done only partially because
static typing (beautiful as it is) is a b*tch when it comes to translating non-typed stuff.

Any help on this project is greatly appreciated.
